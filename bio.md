##Hobies/Interests

* Spending time with my wife and two beautiful chilren is my top priority.
* I enjoy watching mixed martial arts (MMA) and brazilian jiu jitsu (BJJ).
* I love listening to music of all genres, but I prefer heavy aggresive style the most.
* I enjoy playing the drums (although I do not get to play too often!).
* Dido for video games.
* I enjoy being outdoors, whether it is fishing or just sitting around the fire pit, I truly feel at peace outdoors.
