##Hobies/Interests

* Spending time with my wife and two beautiful chilren is my top priority.
* I enjoy watching mixed martial arts (MMA) and brazilian jiu jitsu (BJJ).
* I love listening to music of all genres, but I prefer heavy aggresive style the most.
* I enjoy playing the drums (although I do not get to play too often!).
* Dido for video games.
* I enjoy being outdoors, whether it is fishing or just sitting around the fire pit, I truly feel at peace outdoors.

##Programming Background

#C++

* My only experience with C++ came from CS 161 and CS 162, however I really enjoy this language.
* For my 161 final project I wrote a very basic account manager. What this program did was allow the user to input their username and password for various accounts, such as email, bank accounts, and wireless accounts. There was also an option for the program to generate a random password for any of the accounts should the user decide to do so. One thing to note is that there was no use of any sort of data base system, therefore when the program was exited none of the inputted values were stored. This is a project I would be interested in dabbling in again after I gain some knowledge in data bases.
* For 162, I wrote a fun fantasy combat game as part of the final project that allowed the user to select the combatants and the program ran a simulated battle until only one fighter remained.

#C

* Exposure to C came from the Data Structures class where I implemented several different types including queues, linked lists, hash tables, and many more.

#Assembly Language

* I wrote several programs in MASM for CS 271222.
* These programs included calculating factorials based on user input and calculating and displaying Fibonacci numbers based on user input.

#Python

* Before beggining my studies at OSU, I taught myself some Python syntax and wrote a nifty little script that instructs my laptop to send me an email each time my laptop is booted up.
* I also wrote a very basic web scraper that saves the most current news headlines from an HIV related website (I'm currently a practicing pharmacist in an HIV specialty pharmacy) to a text document.
* I completed the Intro to Python Programming course on Coursera.
